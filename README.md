# Lens Scripting Language
### Original Java Implementation from 2016

Welcome to the Lens Project! This repository contains the source code and [documentation](documentation.pdf) for the legacy (2016) version of the Lens programming language concept.

Lens is a multi-paradigm scripting language designed for seamless usage in both educational and professional environments. 
Using a terse and expressive grammar, Lens is capable of providing students with a strong intuition of the functional, imperative, object-oriented, and symbolic programming paradigms. 

Due to its concise and familiar syntax, evaluators spend less time in training and students spend less time debugging syntax. 

While this version of the language is by no means optimized nor competitive in the current software development industry, this implementation stands as a highly effective resource for holistically introducing people to the world of programming.

Thanks for stopping by! If you would like to use the Lens programming language, please email me and I will be happy to provide integration assistance.
